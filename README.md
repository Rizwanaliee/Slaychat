Slay Chat
Slay chat is a Marketplace based Mobile solution where the doer (service provider) can list their services & customers can search & connect with them via chat.

Doer Discover page
After successfully logging in, the doers will be redirected to a discover page where they can view new, recent, and previous bookings. Using the ‘Favorite’ feature, they can mark them as favorites.

Doer Profile
Doers must fill in details like Personal information, Services, Billing Information, Identity Verification, Company/Individual Info, and Products, and upload work images. After providing the required information, doers will be successfully listed on the app. Customers can then view the doer’s profile and connect with them through chat.

In this project we have APIs for mobile app and custom admin for admin management
